[Wisps of Grief](https://wispsofgrief.netlify.app/) is a minimalist, dark-theme website showcasing poetry about grief hosted on Netlify. The intention was to create an aesthetically pleasing experience where a user's attention is guided towards the poetry and imagery.

## Markdown, HTML, and CSS
The website uses only static HTML and CSS. The HTML files are generated using a custom Python script that builds the files based on a few wrapper templates with the BeautifulSoup library. New poems can easily be added using Markdown. 

## Fonts
The fonts Bahianita and Fire Sans are used, both published under the Open Fonts License. Bahianita is used in the headers, its crookedness representing the vulnerability and fragility that comes with grief. Fire Sans was chosen for its simple elegance and is used for the titles and paragraphs.
